    <h1>Hi, I'm kd3sc.</h1>
    <p>I'm been programming for 5 years since 2019.
    <br/><b>I prioritise in Lua.</b> However, I'm currently learning other languages such as HTML and CSS - which was used to create this website!</p>

    <br>
    <p>Below are some things I've done and projects I have worked on.</p>

    <br><br>

    <h2><u>Smack Handsüñê (Roblox)</u></h2>
    <p>Smack Handsüñê is a game on Roblox that was inspired by two games named Slap Battlesüëè and Ability Wars.
    <br>
    Although the game can be played entirely for fun, <i>the true objective is to obtain all hands.</i></p>
    <br>
    <p>In the game you can smack other players with hands for the game's currency; smacks. You get 1 smack every hit and you can unlock a variety of different hands with smacks. Another method of earning hands is via badges; which require different obtainment methods to unlock. The final method is gamepasses; which is a way to buy something (with Robux) and get it permanently on a game.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p><b>Please note that Smack Handsüñê is currently being worked on and is only accessible to my friends.</b></p>

    <h3><u>Debugging and Fixing Errors - Smack Handsüñê</u></h3>
    <li>Error was caused by having <b>""</b> in the table.</li>
    <li>Reason is <b>TextChatService:DisplayBubble</b> doesn't allow empty messages.</li>
    <li>Fix is to remove the <b>""</b> message; script works after.</li>
