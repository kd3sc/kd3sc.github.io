    <h1>Hi, I'm kd3sc.</h1>
    <p>I've been programming for 5 years since 2019.
    <br/><b>I prioritise in Lua.</b> However, I'm currently learning other languages such as HTML and CSS - which was used to create this website!</p>

    <br>
    <p>Below are some things I've done and projects I have worked on.</p>

    <br><br>

    <h2><u>Smack Handsüñê (Roblox)</u></h2>
    <p>Smack Handsüñê is a game on Roblox that was inspired by two games named Slap Battlesüëè and Ability Wars.
    <br>
    Although the game can be played entirely for fun, <i>the true objective is to obtain all hands.</i></p>
    <br>
    <p>In the game you can smack other players with hands for the game's currency; smacks. You get 1 smack every hit and you can unlock a variety of different hands with smacks. Another method of earning hands is via badges; which require different obtainment methods to unlock. The final method is gamepasses; which is a way to buy something (with Robux) and get it permanently on a game.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p><b>Please note that Smack Handsüñê is currently being worked on and is only accessible to my friends.</b></p>

    <h3><u>Debugging and Fixing Errors - Smack Handsüñê</u></h3>
    <li>Error was caused by having <b>""</b> in the table.</li>
    <li>Reason is <b>TextChatService:DisplayBubble</b> doesn't allow empty messages.</li>
    <li>Fix is to remove the <b>""</b> message; script works after.</li>

    <h3>Problem Solving and Community Support</h3>
    <h4>Situation</h4>
    <p>The OP wanted a part to detect only an NPC instead of a player but could not figure out how to get it to work.</p>
    <h4>Task</h4>
    <p>Make the part detect the OP's NPC and not a player.</p>
    <h4>Action</h4>
    <p>I asked multiple questions to OP on whether he had some things missing (see posts 20+). He told me that those were correct, so I asked some more things to see if they were the issues and those were also correct.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I then asked if it was the NPC that was the problem - so I told him to import a basic rig and see if that rig gets detected by the part; it did. The OP then wanted to know what was wrong with his NPC, so I investigated.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I told OP it was because the <b>HumanoidRootPart</b> was anchored. Once unanchored, the OP's issue was resolved and I was given a solution.</p>
    <h4>Result</h4>
    <p>OP's NPC was detected by the part, and any players touching the part would be ignored.</p>

    <h3>Roblox Studio Code Samples</h3>
    <p>Here are some code samples from Roblox Studio.</p>
    <br><br>

    <h4>This is a sample of code from Smack Handsüñê that handles giving players smacks. If the user owns specific gamepasses, they get the extra smacks as promised. There are also protected calls to ensure the thread doesn't yield if any errors are thrown.</h4>

    <h4>This is a sample of code from Smack Handsüñê that handles selecting different hands that cost smacks to unlock. If the player is already in the arena and they attempt to change hands, they get kicked.</h4>
